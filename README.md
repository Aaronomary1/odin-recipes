In this project I created a few rudimentary HTML files to form a very simple cooking website. There are 3 recipes with image tags, header tags, and list tags. You will find instructions, a description, and ingredients in each recipe. I didn't really learn much to be honest since I learned all of this in CS50 already. Although, playing around with git (which is not in CS50) was interesting and feels good to learn about.
